"""PySide6-Essentials + Qt Quick/QML settings window (XRBM-030/XRBM-031),
replacing the previous Tk view. Every validation/save/launch/log-status
decision below still goes straight through the same pure functions in
``settings_ui.py`` - this module only bridges them to QML via a
`QAbstractListModel` (``ButtonMappingModel``) and two `QObject`s
(``SettingsController``, ``DiagnosticsController``); it never duplicates
that logic.

This module deliberately does NOT import PySide6 at module import time.
``_load_qt_classes()`` performs that import lazily (and caches the result),
so merely importing ``ovb_rc003.qt_settings_app`` - e.g. transitively via
``settings_ui`` in a ``--dry-run`` smoke check, or from a pure test that
only needs ``remote_layout``/``shell_targets`` - never requires PySide6 to
be installed. ``run_settings_window()`` is the only real entry point, and
raises ``QtUnavailableError`` with an actionable message if PySide6-
Essentials is missing (source/dev runs only: the frozen build always bundles
the Qt runtime itself - see build/RemoteMicRC003.spec - so end users
never need to separately install Python or Qt).

``DiagnosticsController`` (XRBM-031's "检查与修复" fourth page) runs every
``windows_diagnostics.run_diagnostics()`` check on a plain background
``threading.Thread`` - never on the Qt GUI thread, so a slow WinRT/PortAudio
call can never freeze the window - and delivers the result back via a
cross-thread Qt signal (``Signal(object)``), which Qt automatically queues
onto the GUI thread because the receiving ``QObject`` was constructed there;
this is the standard, documented way to marshal a background-thread result
back to a Qt object living on a different thread, and needs no ``QThread``
subclass or extra locking. An ``_is_refreshing`` guard refuses to start a
second worker while one is already running (repeated "重新检测" clicks never
overlap).

Thread lifecycle at window close / process exit (XRBM-035, hardened again in
RETRY 1 - a real Windows CI crash, not merely a theoretical race,
superseded the previous "best-effort atexit join + daemon=True is good
enough" contract described here before): every background thread this
controller starts is tracked in ``_diagnostics_threads``, and
``_shutdown_diagnostics_workers()`` signals shutdown and makes a BOUNDED
join attempt on each (``_DIAGNOSTICS_THREAD_JOIN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` per
thread - DERIVED from ``windows_diagnostics.BLE_DISCOVERY_MAX_CANCELLATION_
SECONDS`` plus a safety margin, not an independently-guessed value - see
that constant's own definition below). The critical fix is WHEN this runs:
``run_settings_window()`` now calls it EXPLICITLY, synchronously, from a
``try/finally`` that starts right after ``DiagnosticsController`` is
constructed (i.e. right after its background worker could first exist) and
covers every exit path through ``app.exec()`` returning, ``engine.load()``
raising, or ``rootObjects()`` coming back empty - while every Qt/Python
object it built is still fully alive - not only via this module's
``atexit`` hook (``_shutdown_qt_settings_app_at_exit()``, still registered
as a defense-in-depth safety net for callers that bypass
``run_settings_window()``). A real Windows CI faulthandler dump proved the
old atexit-only timing insufficient: a background BLE-discovery worker was
still deep inside a native WinRT await when the interpreter itself began
finalizing, producing an ``0xC0000005`` access violation - daemon=True only
guarantees CPython does not block exit on a surviving thread, it says
nothing about whether that thread's native call can safely keep running
concurrently with interpreter teardown.

RETRY 1's independent review found the round-1 fix for the discovery side
itself - cancelling the asyncio Task awaiting ``discover_candidates()`` -
was ALSO insufficient: the locked pywinrt wrapper's own post-cancel wait is
itself unbounded (see ``windows_diagnostics.py``'s "-- BLE candidate --"
section for the exact source citation), so an in-process asyncio
cancellation request could never give a real hard bound either. BLE
candidate discovery therefore now runs in a genuinely separate, disposable
OS PROCESS (``windows_diagnostics._run_ble_diagnostics_subprocess()``) that
the parent can forcibly terminate/kill and CONFIRM dead within a real,
OS-enforced bound - the shutdown event doubles as that cancellation signal
(not just an emit-skip flag - see below), so a discovery attempt in flight
when shutdown begins is actually asked to stop and confirmed to have
stopped, giving the bounded join here a realistic chance to succeed instead
of only ever timing out. Every one of these threads is still created with
``daemon=True`` too, as a last-resort backstop if a future failure mode
ever defeats the process-level isolation above.

Shutdown-vs-teardown ordering (XRBM-031 RETRY 2, still true under XRBM-035):
a diagnostics worker still finishing around shutdown time must never emit
its result INTO a ``DiagnosticsController``/Qt runtime that
``_release_qt_classes_cache()`` may already have started tearing down. Two
things make this safe: ``_diagnostics_shutdown_event`` (a module-level
``threading.Event``) is set FIRST, before anything else, by
``_shutdown_diagnostics_workers()`` - ``refreshDiagnostics()`` refuses to
start a new worker once it is set, and a worker already running checks it
immediately before emitting and skips the emit entirely if it is set (any
exception the emit call raises anyway - the receiver could still be
mid-teardown despite the check - is caught and discarded, never crashing
the worker thread); and every worker's ``finally`` block unconditionally
calls ``_forget_diagnostics_thread()``, so the registry is cleaned up even
on that path. ``_shutdown_qt_settings_app_at_exit()`` still runs all three
shutdown steps (flag the shutdown, join outstanding workers, release the Qt
classes cache) in that explicit order, in one function - never relying on
Python's ``atexit`` LIFO-ordered execution of separately registered
functions (see that function's docstring for the full story).

    each step (which is what the original XRBM-031 submission and its RETRY
    1 fix both did): ``atexit`` runs its registered functions in LIFO order
    (last registered, first executed) - registering the join hook first and
    the cache-release hook second, as before, meant the cache release
    actually ran FIRST at real process exit, the reverse of the order this
    module's own docstring already claimed. A diagnostics worker finishing
    right around that window could then emit its result into a
    ``DiagnosticsController``/Qt runtime whose cached classes were already
    being torn down. Collapsing every step into one function and
    registering that ONE function removes the dependency on ``atexit``'s
    LIFO ordering (and the silent-breakage risk of some future edit
    reordering two separate ``atexit.register()`` calls) entirely - the
    order is just ordinary, explicit Python statement order here.

    This remains registered as a defense-in-depth safety net (e.g. for a
    caller that never reaches ``run_settings_window()``'s own explicit
    call) - production windows must never depend on ``atexit`` alone; see
    ``_shutdown_diagnostics_workers()``'s docstring for why.
